To create a ggplot visualization for the linear model (lm_model1) in your R script, you can plot the predicted values of result against the actual result values. Here's a full example of how you could do this:

R Code
R
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Predict the result using the model
Bin_data$predicted_result <- predict(lm_model1, Bin_data)

# Create a ggplot
ggplot(Bin_data, aes(x = predicted_result, y = result)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2) +  # Scatter plot of predicted vs actual
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +  # Line y=x for reference
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs Actual Result for Bin",
    x = "Predicted Result",
    y = "Actual Result"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation
predict Function: It adds predicted values of the dependent variable (result) based on the model (lm_model1) to your data frame (Bin_data).
geom_point: Displays the scatter plot of actual vs predicted values.
geom_abline: Adds a reference line 
𝑦
=
𝑥
y=x, showing where perfect predictions would fall.
labs: Titles and labels the axes.
theme_minimal: A cleaner aesthetic for the plot.
When you run this code, it will generate a plot that helps you visually evaluate how well the model's predictions align with the actual values of result.

raw_data <- read_csv(here("data/01-raw_data/2024_lol_esport.csv"))  only read the first 10 line

To read the first 10 lines of a CSV file in R, you can use the read_csv() function from the readr package along with the n_max argument to limit the number of lines read. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
library(readr)
library(here)

# Read only the first 10 lines of the CSV file
raw_data <- read_csv(here("data/01-raw_data/2024_lol_esport.csv"), n_max = 10)

# View the loaded data
print(raw_data)
This will read and display the first 10 rows of your CSV file. If the file doesn't exist or the path is incorrect, ensure the file is correctly placed in the specified directory.

could you using #| echo: false
#| warning: false something like that

Here’s the updated R Markdown code using the #| syntax to specify figure dimensions along with other chunk options:

r
Copy code
#| label: fig-avg-pct-state
#| fig-cap: Historical State Voting Trends Are Maintained in 2024
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

# Grouping data by playername and gameid to calculate vision score per game
vision_data <- cleaned_lol_data |>
  group_by(playername, gameid) |>
  summarise(visionscore = sum(visionscore), .groups = "drop")

# Plotting the vision score for each player across games
ggplot(vision_data, aes(x = gameid, y = visionscore, color = playername, group = playername)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Vision Score by Player Across Games",
    x = "Game ID",
    y = "Vision Score",
    color = "Player Name"
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
Explanation:
fig-width and fig-height:
These options specify the width and height of the figure in the output, in inches.
#| syntax:
#| echo: false hides the code in the output.
#| warning: false suppresses warnings in the output.
fig-cap:
Adds a caption to the figure. You can customize this text as needed.
This format adheres to modern R Markdown practices for controlling chunk options using #|.

ggplot(cleaned_lol_data, aes(x = gamelength)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "steelblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Game Duration",
    x = "Game Duration (seconds)",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) mutate it from second into minutes

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To convert the game duration from seconds to minutes, you can create a new variable in the dataset using mutate() and then plot the histogram using the converted values. Here's the updated R code:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Convert game duration from seconds to minutes
cleaned_lol_data <- cleaned_lol_data |>
  mutate(gamelength_minutes = gamelength / 60)

# Plotting a histogram for game duration in minutes
ggplot(cleaned_lol_data, aes(x = gamelength_minutes)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "steelblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Game Duration",
    x = "Game Duration (minutes)",
    y = "Frequency"
  )
Explanation of Changes:
mutate(gamelength_minutes = gamelength / 60):

Adds a new column, gamelength_minutes, which represents the game duration in minutes.
aes(x = gamelength_minutes):

Uses the converted game duration (in minutes) for the histogram.
binwidth = 2:

Adjusts the bin width to 2 minutes for better visualization. You can tweak this based on your data distribution.
This updated code will display the distribution of game durations in minutes, providing a more intuitive representation of the data.

visualize the boxplot for each player total gold earned

Here’s the R code to create a boxplot for the total gold earned by each player:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Creating a boxplot for total gold earned by each player
ggplot(cleaned_lol_data, aes(x = playername, y = totalgold, fill = playername)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 16, alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Gold Earned by Each Player",
    x = "Player Name",
    y = "Total Gold Earned"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
Explanation:
aes(x = playername, y = totalgold, fill = playername):

Maps playername to the x-axis and totalgold to the y-axis.
Fills the boxplots with a unique color for each player.
geom_boxplot():

Creates the boxplot. Outliers are highlighted with red dots (outlier.color = "red").
Customization:

theme_minimal() provides a clean layout.
labs() sets the title and axis labels.
theme() adjusts the x-axis text angle for better readability and hides the legend since it’s not needed.
This boxplot will visualize the distribution of total gold earned by each player, highlighting their median, interquartile range, and outliers.

also the damageto champion make a comparision with total gold
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To compare total gold earned and damage to champions for each player, we can use a facet grid to plot two boxplots side-by-side for each metric. Here's the R code:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Reshape the data for comparison
gold_damage_data <- cleaned_lol_data |>
  select(playername, totalgold, damagetochampions) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(totalgold, damagetochampions),
    names_to = "metric",
    values_to = "value"
  )

# Plot the boxplots for total gold and damage to champions
ggplot(gold_damage_data, aes(x = playername, y = value, fill = metric)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 16, alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~ metric, scales = "free_y", labeller = as_labeller(c(
    "totalgold" = "Total Gold Earned",
    "damagetochampions" = "Damage to Champions"
  ))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Total Gold Earned and Damage to Champions by Player",
    x = "Player Name",
    y = "Value"
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "none"
  )
Explanation:
pivot_longer():

Reshapes the data from wide to long format, combining totalgold and damagetochampions into a single column for comparison.
facet_wrap(~ metric):

Creates separate boxplots for totalgold and damagetochampions side-by-side, with each metric having its own y-axis scale.
scales = "free_y":

Allows each facet to have an independent y-axis scale for better visualization.
labeller:

Provides descriptive labels for the facets (Total Gold Earned and Damage to Champions).
Visualization:

The plot uses colors to differentiate the metrics, while the boxplots show the distribution of each metric for each player.
This visualization allows for a side-by-side comparison of the distributions of total gold earned and damage to champions for each player, highlighting relationships or discrepancies between the two metrics.
